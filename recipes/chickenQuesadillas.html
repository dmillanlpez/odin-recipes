    <!-- Description -->
     <p>A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that consists of a tortilla filled with cheese (and often other ingredients, such as meat and veggies). It’s cooked on a griddle or stove. Full quesadillas feature cheese 
     sandwiched between two flat tortillas. Half quesadillas, like the one in this recipe, is a single tortilla that has been topped with fillings and folded into a half moon shape.  </p>

     <h2>What to Put in a Quesadilla</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Chicken: Of course, you’ll need chicken! This recipe calls for a pound of diced boneless, skinless chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Use store-bought fajita seasoning or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232967/fajita-seasoning/">make your own spice blend at home</a>.</li>
        <li>Vegetables:You’ll need green bell peppers, red bell peppers, and an onion.</li>
        <li>Tortillas: For 10 chicken quesadillas, you’ll need 10 flour tortillas. Use store-bought or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/157642/homemade-flour-tortillas/">homemade tortillas.</a></li>
        <li>Cheese: A blend of shredded Cheddar and shredded Monterey Jack takes the quesadillas up a notch.</li>
        <li>Bacon: Bacon bits lend a burst of savory, meaty texture to the cheesy chicken quesadilla filling. For a more traditional dish, you can easily omit the bacon bits.</li>
     </ul>
