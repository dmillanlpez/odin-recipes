Project Overview

This project is a part of The Odin Project's curriculum, designed to reinforce basic HTML skills. The objective is to build a simple recipe website that includes an index page linking to individual recipe pages. This project focuses purely on HTML structure and content without any CSS styling.

        An image of the finished dish.
